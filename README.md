A page, devoted to handwritten armenian alphabet, in case you forgot it!
## Here's the story!&nbsp;&nbsp; (*don't read it*)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago I decided to start spending some extra time improving my armenian writing skills, so I would occasionally write down a sentence or two, during class breaks *(yes, that's all I was doing :D)* , on a piece of paper, pretending no computers existed yet. To be mentioned, I would often type in armenian on my phone, on a digital keyboard, long before that, so I knew the letters, or at least, I thought so! To my surprise, I would constantly fail trying to recall those handwritten letters, I was taught in school! It was quite annoying, so I made a handy reminder, like this:

The idea was whenever I would forget how to write a certain letter, I would find it on my phone's keyboard, type it into the search bar, find it's index in alphabet, and then look it up on the cheat sheet  you  saw above. Not a quick process, but it worked just fine. Until I lost the first cheat sheet! Then a few others followed and got lost as well. The one that survived my weak memory, faced the horrors of the all-crushing-and-digesting backpack! And so, a better solution was needed.  
Fast forward, I am in a world with COVID-19, quarantined! No university, no backpack, no classes. And to be honest, even no armenian language practice! So I almost forgot a cheat sheet existed(or that I had to be practicing ... anything), until once I had to dig a little deeper into my backpack, and what would I find?! A chewed up creature, on its last breath, namely, the cheat sheet with letters.  
And then I somehow thought of making it in a way, that would not wear off. At all. Never. Ever. Again.   
Sure, I immediately recognised, that was a stupid idea. Why? Well, there was wikipedia, varius videos on youtube, and tonns of pictures, that would show how the letters should be written! Many things! And so,  I resisted it for some time... then it got me... I had to give it a try...  
And here's what I have got: armenian-alphabet.com! Essentially, this is the same cheat sheet in a digital form with a few features that will hopefully be useful.  
The idea is, that not only  you can see the way a  letter is written, but it's also animated, so you can see the process of it being written down! And the coolest feature is that you can control the progress of that animation with a slider, in case the default animation speed is too fast!  

Concluding this long story that probably no one is going to read, this time I have got a feeling that it was actually a good idea, that I could see, and then implement. Because it's not often that you see an idea that
  * does solve a problem
  * can be implemented
  * is interesting enough to keep you engaged  
  
And so it's a triple win here, which I am happy of.
